# Email Verification Feature Documentation

## Overview

The job bot now includes an email verification system to confirm whether job applications were successfully submitted. This feature addresses the issue where users are uncertain if applications are actually being submitted since they're not seeing confirmation emails.

## How It Works

When a job application is submitted, the bot can automatically check your email inbox for confirmation emails from the employer or job platform. This provides an additional layer of verification beyond the visual confirmation on the website.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

To enable email verification, set the following environment variables:

```bash
# Enable/disable email verification
EMAIL_VERIFICATION_ENABLED=true

# Email server configuration (Gmail example)
EMAIL_IMAP_SERVER=imap.gmail.com
EMAIL_IMAP_PORT=993
EMAIL_SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_SMTP_PORT=587

# Your email credentials
PERSONAL_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-app-password

# Verification settings
EMAIL_VERIFICATION_TIMEOUT=300  # 5 minutes timeout
EMAIL_CHECK_INTERVAL=30         # Check every 30 seconds
```

### Gmail Setup

For Gmail users:
1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Google account
2. Generate an App Password for the job bot
3. Use the App Password for `EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`

### Other Email Providers

The bot supports any IMAP-enabled email provider. Common configurations:

**Outlook/Hotmail:**
```bash
EMAIL_IMAP_SERVER=imap.live.com
EMAIL_IMAP_PORT=993
EMAIL_SMTP_SERVER=smtp.live.com
EMAIL_SMTP_PORT=587
```

**Yahoo Mail:**
```bash
EMAIL_IMAP_SERVER=imap.mail.yahoo.com
EMAIL_IMAP_PORT=993
EMAIL_SMTP_SERVER=smtp.mail.yahoo.com
EMAIL_SMTP_PORT=587
```

## Features

### Email Confirmation Detection

The bot searches for confirmation emails using these criteria:
- Emails received after the application submission time
- Subject lines containing keywords like:
  - "application received"
  - "application confirmation"
  - "thank you for applying"
  - "application submitted"
  - Company name
  - Platform name

### Verification Status

Applications are marked with one of these statuses:
- `EMAIL_CONFIRMED`: Confirmation email received
- `EMAIL_PENDING`: No confirmation email found within timeout
- `CONFIRMED`: Visual confirmation on website
- `PENDING`: Application submitted but no confirmation

### Timeout and Retry Logic

- Default timeout: 5 minutes
- Check interval: 30 seconds
- The bot will continue checking until timeout or confirmation is found

## Usage

### Enable Email Verification

Set `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_ENABLED=true` in your environment variables.

### Disable Email Verification

Set `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_ENABLED=false` or remove the environment variable.

### Monitor Verification Status

Check the logs for email verification results:
```
ðŸ“§ Checking email for Software Engineer at TechCorp confirmation...
âœ… Email confirmation found for Software Engineer at TechCorp
ðŸ“§ Email confirmation received for Software Engineer at TechCorp
```

### Log Files

Email verification details are logged to:
- `job_bot.log`: Main application log
- `verification_log.txt`: Detailed verification results

## Security Considerations

1. **App Passwords**: Use app-specific passwords instead of your main email password
2. **Permissions**: The bot only reads emails, it doesn't send or modify them
3. **Data Storage**: Email credentials are not stored permanently
4. **Timeout**: Email checking has a built-in timeout to prevent infinite loops

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Connection Failed:**
- Verify IMAP server and port settings
- Check if less secure apps are enabled (for some providers)
- Ensure app password is correct

**No Confirmation Emails Found:**
- Some companies may not send immediate confirmation emails
- Check spam/junk folders manually
- Increase timeout value if needed

**Authentication Failed:**
- Verify email and app password
- Check if 2FA is enabled and app password is generated
- Try recreating the app password

### Testing Email Configuration

You can test your email configuration by running:
```python
from config import Config
config = Config()
email_config = config.load_config()['email_verification']
print(f"Email verification enabled: {email_config['enabled']}")
print(f"Email: {email_config['email']}")
print(f"IMAP Server: {email_config['imap_server']}")
```

## Implementation Details

### Email Verification Process

1. **Application Submission**: Job application is submitted normally
2. **Email Check Initialization**: Bot connects to IMAP server
3. **Search for Confirmations**: Searches recent emails for confirmation keywords
4. **Status Update**: Updates application status based on findings
5. **Logging**: Records verification results in logs

### Code Structure

- `_check_email_confirmation()`: Main email verification method
- `_extract_email_body()`: Extracts text content from emails
- Email verification integrated into `apply_to_job()` method

### Performance Considerations

- Email checking runs in background after application
- Timeout prevents indefinite waiting
- Limited email search scope (last 50 emails)
- Configurable check intervals

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
- Support for more email providers
- Better keyword matching algorithms
- Email template recognition
- Notification system for confirmations
- Dashboard for tracking verification status

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the troubleshooting section
2. Review log files for error messages
3. Verify email configuration settings
4. Test email connectivity separately
