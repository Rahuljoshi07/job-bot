### Database Integration

The system automatically saves detailed scoring data to your SQLite database:

```sql
CREATE TABLE job_scoring (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    job_id TEXT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    overall_score REAL,
    skills_score REAL,
    experience_score REAL,
    location_score REAL,
    salary_score REAL,
    company_score REAL,
    title_relevance REAL,
    description_match REAL,
    requirements_match REAL,
    nlp_similarity REAL,
    sentiment_score REAL,
    urgency_score REAL,
    competition_score REAL,
    growth_potential REAL
);
```

## 🎮 How It Works

### Automatic Enhancement
Your existing job bot automatically uses the enhanced scoring when available:

```python
# Original basic scoring still works
job.relevance_score = basic_scorer.calculate_relevance_score(user_profile, job)

# Enhanced scoring automatically kicks in
if ADVANCED_SCORING_AVAILABLE:
    advanced_metrics = advanced_scorer.score_job(job_data)
    
    # Use the better score
    if advanced_metrics.overall_score > job.relevance_score:
        job.relevance_score = advanced_metrics.overall_score
    
    # Enhanced skills scoring
    job.skill_match_percentage = max(
        job.skill_match_percentage, 
        advanced_metrics.skills_score
    )
```

### Smart Decision Making
The bot now makes much smarter decisions:

- **Jobs scoring 80%+**: Excellent matches - Apply immediately
- **Jobs scoring 70-79%**: Good matches - Definitely apply  
- **Jobs scoring 60-69%**: Fair matches - Consider applying
- **Jobs scoring <60%**: Poor matches - Skip

### Scam Detection
Built-in sentiment analysis detects and filters out scam jobs:

```python
scam_keywords = [
    'make money fast', 'work from home guaranteed', 
    'no experience required', 'earn $1000+ daily'
]
```
